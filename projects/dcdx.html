                <p>During my COVID-19 gap year, I served as Head of Research at a Gen Z consulting startup. We provided research and marketing services to major clients including Snapchat, Chipotle, and Spotify. Beyond leading client-specific research projects, I contributed regularly to the company blog, offering insights on Gen Z trends and cultural patterns.
                <br><br>
                My research process, though still developing at the time (I've since developed a more rigorous approach), was largely self-directed. I would compile potential research topics and brief our founder, collaboratively deciding which ones to advance into full research projects. The research phase began with web scraping social media discourse, reviewing academic literature, and analyzing broader cultural conversations. This initial exploration helped me develop targeted research questions for our growing network of Gen Z ambassadors (known as "the Loop"). Data collection involved multiple formats: Google Forms questionnaires, group Zoom sessions, and one-on-one interviews.
                <br><br>
                Using Google Sheets, I consolidated and analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data. The final step was transforming these findings into compelling narratives for our clients. This involved synthesizing the research into various formats - decks, articles, emails - while incorporating graphic design, data visualization, and strategic copywriting.
