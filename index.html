                <h3>Andrew Roth, <em>Founder @ dcdx</em></h3>
                <p class="review-point">Tulsi is one of those people that just get it. Her ability to find deeper meaning amidst a sea of noise is unparalleled, and her seemingly intuitive understanding of human behavior is scarily on point. The work she did with us at dcdx over a year ago as an intern still stands the test of time as some of our most thought-provoking and loved writing from our audience.</p>

                <h3>Agnieska Kroczek, <em>Product Designer @ CNN</em></h3>
                <p class="review-point">Creative, well-spoken, collaborative, and insightful. I worked with Tulsi on a research project at CNN Underscored. Her research compilation was so effective that it would remain a pattern to follow. Tulsi’s super strength is her openness to tackle projects big and small. She brings energy, freshness, intellect, and a creative spark. Working with Tulsi has been a pleasure, and I can't wait to see what she'll tackle next!</p>
