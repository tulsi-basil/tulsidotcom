                <h3>Keiichi Matsuda, <em>Director @ Liquid City</em></h3>
                <p class="review-point"> 
                    Tulsi’s work at Liquid City consists of researching, designing, prototyping and documenting novel XR and AI-based experiences. Tulsi plays an important role throughout the development of each project, bringing her strong research and rapid prototyping skills, and independent spirit. Tulsi is comfortable working quickly in many forms of media, and a quick study in the many tools and emerging technologies she is uses in her work.

                <h3>Andrew Roth, <em>Founder @ dcdx</em></h3>
                <p class="review-point">Tulsi is one of those people that just get it. Her ability to find deeper meaning amidst a sea of noise is unparalleled, and her seemingly intuitive understanding of human behavior is scarily on point. The work she did with us at dcdx over a year ago as an intern still stands the test of time as some of our most thought-provoking and loved writing from our audience.</p>

                <h3>Agnieska Kroczek, <em>Product Designer @ CNN</em></h3>
                <p class="review-point">Creative, well-spoken, collaborative, and insightful. I worked with Tulsi on a research project at CNN Underscored. Her research compilation was so effective that it would remain a pattern to follow. Tulsi’s super strength is her openness to tackle projects big and small. She brings energy, freshness, intellect, and a creative spark. Working with Tulsi has been a pleasure, and I can't wait to see what she'll tackle next!</p>
